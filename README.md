# MLP-Perceptron-Diffusion

Neural network learns to recreate famous paintings by mapping coordinates to colors. Watch the learning process in real-time!

## How It Works

This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to learn the mapping between pixel coordinates (x, y) and their corresponding RGB color values in famous paintings. As the network trains, you can watch it gradually recreate the painting, pixel by pixel.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of the learning process
- Support for various famous paintings
- Adjustable network architecture
- Interactive parameter tuning
- Export trained models and generated images

## Coming Soon

- Web interface for uploading custom images
- More sophisticated network architectures
- Animation export functionality
